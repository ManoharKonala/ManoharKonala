# Konala Venkata Rama Manohar — Elite GitHub Profile

## 👋 About me
**Konala Venkata Rama Manohar** (GitHub: `@ManoharKonala`) — Pulse. Build. Roar.

A compact, production-ready GitHub profile scaffold with a unique interactive terminal-based visitor experience that updates automatically via GitHub Actions. This profile focuses on showcasing your best work, your story, and the unique interactive strength of an in-readme terminal, backed by automation.

---

## ✨ Unique Factor — INTERACTIVE TERMINAL SIMULATOR
This profile uses an interactive, auto-generated SVG terminal that imports latest stats and recent commits from your GitHub repos. The terminal reacts to visitor interactions (via pre-generated SVG updates and advanced GitHub Actions). Implemented features:
- `whoami` → Bio and background.
- `ls -la projects` → A curated project list with short descriptions.
- `cat skills.json` → Machine-readable skillset.
- `git log` → Recent activity summary.
- `./run_portfolio.sh` → Runs a pre-generated showcase animation (SVG/GIF).
- `sudo make-me-a-sandwich` → A playful easter egg inserted by the `easter-egg-generator` workflow.

> NOTE: GitHub READMEs don't allow inline JS execution for security reasons. To achieve the interactive effect, we generate an animated SVG and update it on a schedule with GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 What's included
- `README.md` — this file with an embedded terminal (SVG) and full documentation
- `.github/workflows/` — 5 automated workflows to maintain dynamic content
- `assets/terminal/` — SVG/HTML/CSS sources and generated terminal asset
- `scripts/` — Python scripts that call GitHub API to fetch data, build assets and update README
- `data/` — generated JSON data produced by scripts
- `tests/` — pytest tests for core script functions

---

## 🧭 Quickstart
1. Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available for Actions (Actions set GITHUB_TOKEN automatically). If you run locally, set `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Generate data locally (optional):

```bash
scripts/update_stats.py --owner ManoharKonala
```

4. Generate the terminal asset:

```bash
python scripts/generate_terminal.py --data data/stats.json --out assets/terminal/terminal.svg
```

5. Run tests:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## ⚙️ Overview of Workflows
- `.github/workflows/dynamic-stats-updater.yml` — runs every 6 hours; updates `data/stats.json`.
- `.github/workflows/interactive-element-manager.yml` — runs hourly; regenerates terminal assets from data.
- `.github/workflows/featured-projects-curator.yml` — runs daily; picks top projects and refreshes `projects.json`.
- `.github/workflows/visitor-engagement-tracker.yml` — runs on push; appends the push event and updates a short engagement log.
- `.github/workflows/easter-egg-generator.yml` — runs weekly; rotates easter eggs.

---

## 🧱 Implementation notes
- Scripts are designed to be safe for GitHub Actions. They use `GITHUB_TOKEN` to authenticate and commit artifacts back to the repository.
- All dynamic assets are pre-generated by Actions; the README references the generated `assets/terminal/terminal.svg` (static image in the repository), providing a visually interactive feel without client-side JS.

---

## ♿ Accessibility & Performance
- All generated SVGs include accessible text nodes to help screen readers.
- SVGs and images are optimized during generation for fast loads.

---

## 🛠 Customization
- Edit `scripts/generate_terminal.py` to change the textual content or the look of the terminal.
- Customize `assets/terminal/styles.css` to match the cyberpunk theme.

---

## What's next
- Confirm branch changes, review the scripts, and merge the PR to enable scheduled GitHub Actions runs.
- If you'd like Option B–F instead, I can swap the interactive factor and rework the generator scripts.
